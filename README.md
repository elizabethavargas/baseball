# ⚾ Barrel → Home Run: A Causal Analysis

This project explores whether a barrel (a well-struck batted ball, as defined by MLB Statcast) has a causal relationship with the likelihood of a home run. While barrels are strongly correlated with home runs, correlation alone does not imply causation. Our goal is to test whether a barrel truly causes an increased chance of a home run, or if other factors (e.g., ballpark conditions, player characteristics) explain the relationship.
